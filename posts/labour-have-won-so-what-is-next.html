<h1>Labour Have Won: So What is Next?</h1>
<p><b>05 July 2024</b></p>
<p>The 2024 UK general election has created a significant political shift, with Keir Starmer and the Labour Party securing a resounding majority. This victory has particularly transformed the political landscape in the North East, which is now overwhelmingly dominated by Labour MPs. This of course follows the recent election of Labour's Kim McGuinness as the Mayor of the North East.</p>
<p>But what does this mean for small businesses, sustainability, and the North East region?</p>
<h3>Opportunities for Small Businesses</h3>
<p>Labour's manifesto emphasises the role of small businesses in driving economic growth and creating jobs. In the North East, small businesses form the backbone of the local economy, contributing significantly to employment and innovation. <a href="https://labour.org.uk/change/kickstart-economic-growth/#small-business-self-employed/">Labour plans to introduce a comprehensive package to support small businesses</a>, including tackling late payments, improving access to capital, and reforming procurement rules to give small enterprises better access to government contracts. These initiatives are designed to create a more equitable business environment and encourage entrepreneurial activity in the region.</p>
<p>One of the key challenges will be ensuring these policies effectively address the unique needs of small businesses without introducing new administrative burdens. For example, while reforms to procurement rules aim to increase access for small businesses, it will be crucial to streamline these processes to avoid overwhelming smaller firms with additional administrative requirements. Additionally, the implementation of measures to ensure timely payments will need careful monitoring to ensure compliance and effectiveness.</p>
<p><a href="https://labour.org.uk/change/kickstart-economic-growth/#business-taxation">Labour's approach to providing stability and certainty is business taxation</a>, including capping corporation tax and introducing a roadmap for business taxation for the next parliament, which hopes to encourage long-term planning and investment by small businesses. However, the transition to new tax structures and ensuring clarity in these new rules will be vital to avoid confusion and unintended consequences for businesses already navigating challenging economic conditions.</p>
<p>In the North East, these initiatives could lead to a more vibrant and resilient small business sector, capable of driving local economic growth and job creation. However, continuous engagement with small business owners will be essential to fine-tune these policies and address the challenges that inevitably emerge.</p>
<h3>Opportunities for Sustainability</h3>
<p>Labour plans to establish <a href="https://labour.org.uk/change/make-britain-a-clean-energy-superpower/">Great British Energy</a>, a publicly-owned clean power company, which hopes to cut energy bills and boost energy security by investing in renewable energy sources. This initiative is expected to create 650,000 new jobs and make significant steps towards a zero-carbon electricity system by 2030.</p>
<p>In the North East, which boasts a strong industrial heritage and significant potential for renewable energy development, this commitment to sustainability presents a transformative opportunity. <a href="https://labour.org.uk/change/make-britain-a-clean-energy-superpower/#clean-power">Labour plans to invest in green infrastructure</a>, including carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, and marine energy, ensuring that the UK becomes a leader in clean energy technology. This will hopefully not only contribute to reducing carbon emissions but also create new economic opportunities in the green energy sector.</p>
<p>However, the ambitious targets for renewable energy expansion will require substantial coordination between the new government and industry. Ensuring that the necessary infrastructure and regulatory frameworks are in place to support rapid growth in renewable energy capacity will be critical. Additionally, managing the transition for communities and workers currently dependent on fossil fuel industries will need to be handled with care to prevent economic disruption.</p>
<p>For the North East, these initiatives could lead to the development of new green industries, creating high-quality jobs and driving regional economic growth. The success of these initiatives, of course, will depend on effective implementation and continuous support for (and from) local industries and workers.</p>
<h3>Opportunities for Regional Development and Devolution</h3>
<p>The North East stands to benefit significantly from <a href="https://labour.org.uk/change/kickstart-economic-growth/#growth-across-the-country">Labour's regional development policies</a>. The party has committed to deepening devolution, giving more power to local authorities to drive growth and improve public services. This includes new powers over transport, adult education, skills, housing, and planning.</p>
<p><a href="https://labour.org.uk/change/kickstart-economic-growth/#get-britain-building-again">Labour's focus on building 1.5 million new homes over the next parliament</a>, prioritising brownfield development, and supporting the creation of new towns hopes to address housing shortages and stimulate local economies. The North East, with its strong Labour representation, is likely to see substantial investment in infrastructure and housing, hoping to grow the regional economy.</p>
<p>However, the effectiveness of these regional development policies will hinge on the capacity of local authorities to manage and deploy these new powers effectively. Ensuring that local governments have the necessary resources and expertise to handle increased responsibilities will be crucial. The success of housing initiatives will naturally depend on overcoming planning and regulatory hurdles, as well as addressing community concerns about development projects.</p>
<p>For the North East, this could mean revitalised town centres, improved public services, and enhanced local governance. However, achieving these outcomes will require sustained investment in local capacity building and effective collaboration between central and local governments.</p>
<h3>Impact on Sustainable Small Businesses</h3>
<p>Sustainable small businesses in the North East stand to gain significantly from Labour's focus on green energy and sustainability. These businesses, which include eco-friendly product manufacturers, renewable energy providers, and sustainable agriculture enterprises, will benefit from increased investment in <a href="https://labour.org.uk/change/make-britain-a-clean-energy-superpower/#clean-power">green infrastructure and support for local energy projects</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://labour.org.uk/change/make-britain-a-clean-energy-superpower/#gb-energy">Labour's commitment to creating a decarbonised electricity system by 2030</a> and investing in renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and hydrogen, presents numerous opportunities for small sustainable businesses to expand and innovate. These initiatives aim to not only reduce operational costs through lower energy bills but also create new markets and demand for sustainable products and services.</p>
<p>However, sustainable small businesses will need to navigate any challenges of scaling up to meet increased demand and ensuring compliance with new regulations and standards. Continuous support from government programs, access to finance, and an emphasis on collaboration will be essential to maximise the potential benefits of Labour's sustainability agenda.</p>
<br>
<p>Labour's victory at this general election presents an opportunity for growth in the North East, with substantial support offered for small businesses and a commitment to sustainability. By focusing on regional development and deepening devolution, Labour is aiming to foster economic growth.</p>
<p>However, the successful implementation of these initiatives will require careful monitoring, adaptive policymaking, and robust support for local authorities to ensure that the promised benefits are realised and challenges are effectively managed.</p>
<p>While Labour's ambitious plans hold great promise for the North East, continuous engagement with local communities, businesses, and the region's local authorities will be essential to ensure that these opportunities are fully realised and the inevitable challenges are effectively addressed.</p>
