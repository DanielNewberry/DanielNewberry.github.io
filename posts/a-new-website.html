<h1>A <s>new</s> website</h1>
<p><b>2024-06-07</b></p>
	<p>Hello!</p>
	<p>This is my <s>1st</s> <s>2nd</s> <s>3rd</s> <s>4th</s> <s>5th</s> <s>6th</s> <s>7th</s> <s>8th</s> 9th attempt at a personal website. I've had many websites before, but they didn't do what I wanted them to do (mainly because I didn't take the time to learn <i>how</i> to get them to do what I wanted them to do).
	<p>Previously I've used all-in-one website builders and hosting such as Squarespace and Weebly, the Canva Websites builder that comes with the Canva Pro membership and website builder frameworks such as Hugo (built on the Go Language).</p>
	<p>Whilst they all had their merits, there were too many issues for me to deal with.</p>
	<p>Squarespace looked great and had a lot of dynamic responsiveness built in. But it was expensive and there were so many barriers to posting content such as navigating menues and waiting for elements to load in. I realised it was great for dynamic websites, which I simply didn't need (or want).</p>
	<p>Weebly was a nightmare. Poor mobile optimisation and the drag-and-drop was limited.</p>
	<p>Canva Websites was good for teh ease of setting it up, however it would be expensive if I wasn't already paying for the Canva Pro membership. Again, mobile optimisation was poor - arguably the worst out of every website build I have used. And there were no blogging or posting features so anything outside of a one-page website was impossible without creating multiple designs.</p>
	<p>The Hugo framework was good, but there were a lot of learning curves. Also, I realised that when compiling the website to update, it was just updating and creating new HTML and CSS files.</p>
	<p>Hugo got me closest to how I wanted the website to look and work, especially when running the <a href="https://github.com/g-hanwen/hugo-theme-nostyleplease">no-style-please!</a> theme.</p>
	<p>I'm a big fan of more minimal looking websites where information is front and center. When I found the <a href="https://newcss.net">new.css</a> stylesheet I realised that I would be able to design the exact website that I wanted.</p>
	<p>So I have - I'm just editing changes directly as HTML in Sublime Text and pushing changes to a <a href="https://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a> repository. This lets me use a custom domain and as long as the repository is kept as open source, hosts the website for free too.</p>
	<p>Perfect.</p>
