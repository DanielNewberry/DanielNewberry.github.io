<h1>Episodic Interviewing</h1>
<p><b>17 Jun 2024</b></p>
<p>Episodic interviewing is a qualitative research technique that focuses on eliciting detailed and vivid accounts of particular episodes or events in a participant's life. Unlike other interviewing methods that may encourage more abstract reflections, episodic interviewing focuses more on concrete experiences. This specificity helps participants recall and describe their experiences more vividly and accurately.</p>
<p>The core of episodic interviewing lies in its emphasis on specific events (or episodes). Instead of asking general questions, the interviewer prompts participants to recount specific instances related to the research topic. This approach anchors the conversation in concrete experiences, making it easier for participants to provide detailed descriptions.</p>
<p>To help participants recall specific details, as interviewers we might use memory triggers. These can include questions about particular dates, locations, people involved, or sensory details (what they saw, heard, felt). Memory triggers act as cues that bring specific episodes to the forefront of the participant's mind.</p>
<p>Participants are encouraged to provide rich, detailed descriptions of the episodes, encompassing the context, actions, thoughts, feelings, and outcomes. This level of detail helps build a comprehensive picture of the event, which can offer deeper insights into the participant's experience.</p>
<p>Focusing on specific episodes allows researchers to gain a deeper understanding of the context in which events occurred and the personal meanings participants attach to these events.</p>
<p>While the emphasis is on specific episodes, participants typically - and often naturally - include narrative elements, telling the story of the episode with a beginning, middle, and an end. This narrative structure helps convey the flow and dynamics of the event, which can make recounting easier for the participant.</p>
<p>Instead of asking a general question like, "How do you feel about your job?" an episodic interviewing approach would be, "Can you describe a specific day at work that stands out to you, where something significant happened? What was the situation, and how did you feel about it?"</p>
<p>This type of question encourages the participant to recall a vivid, specific event, often providing a richer and more detailed account.</p>
