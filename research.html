<h1>Research</h1>
<p>Through my PhD, I am currently exploring sustainable entrepreneurship within the North East of England, with the main research objective being to critically analyse the centrality of the owner-manager in a green-green micro-business.</p>
<p>This research builds on previous studies about small businesses, sustainability and the individuality of business owners. It explores the interactions and dynamics between various contexts surrounding the business owner-manager, their green-green business, and the different contextual impacts they experience.</p>
<p>With a background in the arts and creative industries, I am also interested in grassroots arts development within the North East of England.</p>
