	As a Doctoral Researcher, I am currently exploring sustainable entrepreneurship within the North East of England, with the main research objective being to critically analyse the centrality of the owner-manager in green micro-businesses.

	This research builds on previous studies about small businesses, sustainability and the individuality of business owners. It explores the interactions and dynamics between various contexts surrounding the business owner-manager, their green business, and the different contextual impacts they experience.

	With a background in the arts and creative industries, I am also interested in exploring grassroots arts development within the North East of England.
