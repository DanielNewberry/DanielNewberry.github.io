<h1>I'm Glad I Never Learned How to Use My Tablet</h1>
<p><b>05 Aug 2024</b></p>
<p>In a world full of notifications and notification lights, not learning how to fully use my tablet has one of the best decisions I have ever made.</p>
<p>I was originally looking at getting an iPad but I couldn't justify it as an investment. Too high a cost for a device that does everything my Macbook and iPhone can do.</p>
<p>A month ago I bought a (second hand) Onyx Boox Nova 3 after finding one for a quarter of the price of a new iPad. I got it with the intention of using it just to read, write notes and annotate PDFs. But it can do a lot more than that. It's a full Android tablet that can browse the web, receive notifications, run apps, send emails, play games and a whole lot more.</p>
<p>But I have just kept it for reading and writing.</p>
<p>By not diving into the tablet's full functionality, I've eliminated a lot of distractions. No notifications, no internet rabbit holes - just me and my notes. This has massively improved my focus. Without the temptation to check social media or browse the web (browsing on an e-ink device is horrendous anyway), I have been able to focus on my work.</p>
<p>I think for me this tablet combines the best of both worlds: the feel of writing by hand and the convenience of digital storage. I can search through my notes, sync them across devices and access them anywhere. It’s like having a never-ending notebook that magically organises everything for me.</p>
<p>By not fully utilising my most of the capabilities, I've adopted a more mindful approach to this piece of technology. I’ve defined its role in my life, giving me a sense of control and purpose. Technology should serve us, not overwhelm us.</p>
<p>If you’re overwhelmed by digital noise, try simplifying your tech use. You might find that doing less helps you achieve more.</p>
