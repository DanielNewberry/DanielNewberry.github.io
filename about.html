<h1>About</h1>
<br>
I am a PhD Candidate and Researcher at <a href="https://www.ncl.ac.uk">Newcastle University Business School</a>, currently focusing on sustainability, entrepreneurship, the environment and SMEs in the UK.
<br><br>
<h2>Background</h2>
<br>
<p>
I started my PhD in 2021 after earning an MA in Arts, Business, and Creativity and a BA (Hons) in Music from Newcastle University.
<br><br>
During my undergraduate studies, I founded a record label in Newcastle that releases music digitally and on cassette. I later expanded into a creative media consultancy, providing marketing and communications support for SMEs in the North East of England.
<br><br>
While managing both businesses, I pursued an MA to explore the connection between the arts, creative industries, and business. My dissertation sparked an interest in how environmental sustainability impacts small businesses, leading to my current PhD research in Business and Management at Newcastle University Business School.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Research</h2>
<br>
<p>
I am currently exploring sustainable entrepreneurs within the North East of England, with the main research objective being to critically analyse the centrality of the owner-manager in a green-green micro-business.
<br><br>
This research aims to build on previous studies about small businesses, sustainable development, and the individuality of business owners. It will explore the interactions and dynamics between various contexts surrounding the business owner-manager, their green-green business, and the different contextual impacts they experience.
