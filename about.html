	I'm a Doctoral Researcher at <a href="https://www.ncl.ac.uk/business">Newcastle University Business School</a>, currently focusing on sustainability, entrepreneurship, the environment and SMEs in the UK. My academic background includes an MA in Arts, Business, and Creativity, and a BA (Hons) in Music, both from Newcastle University.
	
	During my undergraduate studies, I founded a record label and later a creative media consultancy, providing marketing and communications support for SMEs in the North East of England. These experiences led me to pursue an MA, where I explored the connection between the arts, creative industries, and business. My master's degree dissertation sparked an interest in how environmental sustainability impacts small businesses, leading to <a href="/research">my current doctoral research</a>.

	In 2024, I was awarded a Policy Fellowship from the <a href="https://www.ncl.ac.uk/translational-research/our-network/network-directory/directory/nupa/">Newcastle University Policy Academy</a>, enabling me to connect my research with practical policy-making in sustainable business development and environmental sustainability. This fellowship has allowed me to engage in policy discussions and contribute to evidence-based policies supporting SMEs and micro-businesses in the North East of England.

	Since 2020, I have also been a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts (FRSA), participating in projects that deliver social benefit such as Universal Basic Income (UBI) and Creative Corridors.
