<h1>About</h1>
<p>I'm a PhD Candidate and Researcher at <a href="https://www.ncl.ac.uk/business">Newcastle University Business School</a>, currently focusing on sustainability, entrepreneurship, the environment and SMEs in the UK.</p>
<p>I started my PhD in September 2021 after completing an MA in Arts, Business and Creativity and a BA (Hons) in Music from Newcastle University.</p>
<p>During my undergraduate studies, I founded a record label in Newcastle that realeased music digitally and on cassette tapes. I later started a creative media consultancy, providing marketing and communications support for SMEs in the North East of England.</p>
<p>While running both businesses, I pursued my MA to explore the connection between the arts, creative industries and business. My dissertation sparked an interest in how environmental sustainability impacts small businesses, leading to <a href="./research">my current PhD research</a>.</p>
<h4>Policy</h4>
<p>In 2024, I was awarded a Fellowship for the Newcastle University Policy Academy. This fellowship will help me connect my research with practical policy-making in areas such as sustainable business development and environmental sustainability. Through this, I am engaging in regional and national policy discussions, using my research to shape policies that support sustainable business practices and development.</p>
<p>My focus is on collaborating with policymakers, industry leaders, academics and other stakeholders to advocate for a supportive environment for SMEs and micro-businesses, particularly in the North East of England. Integrating insights from my PhD research, I aim to contribute to evidence-based policies that promote environmental sustainability and economic growth.</p>
<h4>Other</h4>
<p>Since 2020 I have been a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts (FRSA). Through this I have been involved in  RSA projects that deliver social benefit, including work on a Universal Basic Income (UBI) and the development of Creative Corridors.</p>
